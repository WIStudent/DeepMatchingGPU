# DeepMatchingGPU
A modified version of [DeepMatchingGPU](http://lear.inrialpes.fr/src/deepmatching/) that is compatible with [Caffe 1.0](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe) and Ubuntu 16.10.

Since the original version of DeepMatchingGPU was written Caffe's include structure changed, which made it necessary to update some include instructions in DeepMatchingGPU's code. Also the Makefile was rewritten in order to work on Ubuntu.

See INSTALLATION.md for step-by-step instructions on how to compile Caffe and DeepMatchingGPU. See ORIGINAL_README.md for more information about DeepMatchingGPU.
